In particular, we want to look into how stimuli which are not consciously perceived -- so-called subthreshold or invisible stimuli -- and which are irrelevant to a task influence task performance. In general, the authors propose two different hypotheses regarding this influence: first, that irrelevant, invisible stimuli disrupt task performance more as their intensity increases; or second, that there is no effect of this type of stimulus on task performance, as they are being filtered out or suppressed."

In this task, participants are presented a small circle in the middle of the screen, which shows a sequence of a total of six letters and two numbers one by one. This means that each trial consists of eight screens, which are presented one after another, with a 45 ms interval in between them, during which a blank screen is being shown. This sequence is task-relevant, as participants have to focus on it and after each trial, report the two numbers which have been shown to them throughout the whole sequence. In addition to that, there is task-irrelevant component: a dynamic random-dot (DRD) display in the background, which appears within a larger circle surrounding the central circle showing the previously explained sequence. The DRD display varies across trials with regard to both the coherence ratio of the dots and their motion."
